        <h1>About Canine Liability Insurance</h1>
        <p>It's likely that the seed to become a champion for man's best friend was planted in Deborah Turner years ago when, as a child, she witnessed an act of animal abuse yet was powerless to stop it. Fast forward to today, when Debbie has parlayed her love of dogs, a deep understanding of their behavior, and a strong background in insurance to replace coverage that is being removed from homeowners and rental policies with Canine Liability Insurance.</p>
        <p>While doing resarch for a paper for the prestigious Society of Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriters (aka CPCU), it occurred to her that there is a gross misunderstanding by the insurance industry as to which dogs developing a rating modality that incorporates identifiable factors as to the likelihood a dog will bite regardless of the breed. The most often question asked is will she insure one of the so-called dangerous breeds, and the answer is yes! The Canine Liability Policy is designed for any and ALL Breeds of dogs.</p>
        <h3>Inside the Canine Liability Insurance Policy</h3>
        <p>Debbie developed the Canine Liability Policy offering protection for dog owners in the event their dog(s) injures a person or another animal. Each dog is individually underwritten examining those characteristics that play a part in the propensity for dog biting. Policy limits range from $25,000 - $300,000. Debbie also has the ability to include additional insureds if required. In stark contrast to other programs, Canine Liability insurance does not exclude any particular breed of dog; this approach is central to Debbie's unique understanding of dog behavior that has turned underwriting this risk on its floppy ear.</p>
        <p>The Program initially began in 2012 avaliable in a limited number of states. Today Canine Lianility coverage is available in all states except Alaska. The policy has also been redesigned to offer much broader coverage with no deductible. You can request a quote by filling out an online application and emailing it to <a href='mailto:dturner@deaninsuranceai.com' class='debbie'>dturner@deaninsuranceai.co</a>, or by completing the lead form on this page for more information.</p>
        <p>The policy was originally sold through a subsidiary of her agency Federation of Insured Dog Owners aka F.I.D.O., and is now sold through Debbie's agency, Dean Insurance Agency, Inc. Dean Insurance was established in 1994 and provides a broad range of insurance products and services to personal and business customers.</p>
        <p>Debbie has recently been nominated a finalist for Woman of the Year in the Pet Industry Network.</p>

        <div class='f&qQuestions'>
          <h5>Do you cover all breeds?</h5>

          <h5>What is a canine liability policy?</h5>
          <p>It is a standalone policy that covers injuries or damages which are caused by your dog. Most people think only of dog bites; however, bites are just one reason people are suing dog owners. If your dog scratches, scares, causes a person to fall or if your dog injures another animal, it is likely you will hear from a lawyer. Coverage is provided on and off your premises anywhere in the United States. Many landlords and municiplities are requesting to be added as "Additional Insureds" providing them with liability coverage for injuries or damages caused by your dog and so they can be notified of any changes or cancelations.</p>

          <h5>Do you have payment plans?</h5>
          <p>Payment options and plans will vary depending on the amount of the premium they will appear on the page with your quote. The <span class='boldStatment'>QUOTE</span> you will receive is for an annula policy which is 12 months or one year. All payments must be received and authorized by either a debit or credit card processing company. The charges will appear on your statement from "Dual Commercial" they are assisting us. The only Rip Off reports about the program are the result of cancellation due to nonpayment of premiums, only the Insurer can reinstate coverage we do not have the authority to without their approval. <span class='boldStatment'>There is no Deductible!</span></p>
          <h5>What Limits are Available?</h5>
          <p>We have four options for coverage $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, and $300,000. At this time we are unable to assist with higher limits such as $500,000 and up.</p>
          <h5>What if my Dog has a behavior history or has been labeled dangerous by a governing body?</h5>
          <p>We are willing to review all dogs. YOu will be asked to give us information on the incident or incidents leading to the label. If your quote comes back as "referral", that means the underwriters want to review your application closer. You will receive the final decision in a separate email.</p>
          <h5>I need coverage because my dog works with me or comes to work with me</h5>
          <p>If your dog goes to work with you but does not assist you, other than greeting customers or visiting with staff or employees, we can include coverage.</p>
          <h5>I need coverage because my dog is integral or involved in my work.</h5>
          <p>If you use your dog in your line of work and consider it to be "Involved" or "Integral" we can provide coverage. For example, many dogs are used in certain lines of work to sniff out bombs, drugs, bed bugs, phsical therapy or counseling.</p>
          <h5>What is an "Addirional Insured"?</h5>
          <p>You may be asked to name your landlord, employer, a governmental entity or other interested parties on the policy in the event your dog injures someone or causes damage. You may add one or more, but you must have their name, address, and contact information (either phone or e-mail). There is $50 charge per separate address to add them to your policy. You do not need to add a spouse, significant other or family member as an "Additional Insured", if they reside at the same address as you, as they are already covered under the policy.</p>
          <h5>What does the "Additional Insured" endorsement do?</h5>
          <p>If your dog injures a person or another animal and your landlord or other "Additional Insured" is sued, this policy will protect you and your landlord (and any other "Additional Insured") for medical costs for the injured party, defense costs and settlement costs, if any.</p>
          <h5>Explain Diligent Effort Form or Surplus Lines disclosure statement.</h5>
          <p>This coverage is available through the Excess and Surplus marketplace. These types of policies are often called non-admitted or non-licensed. The primary difference between this policy and and admitted policy is that if the insurance company were to go out of business, there would be no protection under your State Guraranty Fund. However, this policy is through one of the largest syndicates at Lloyd's of London is one of the oldest insurance providers in the world. To prove that you have been made aware that the policy is non-admitted, you may have to sign a form predetermined by your state.</p>

          <p>There is a tab for "Changes". Simply complete the information and it will be sent for processing. If there are additional charges, we will be in touch. Changes are not automated yet, so it will take some time to get proof of changes to you. Normally, this should take about 1-2 weeks to process. If it is urgent, please let us know.</p>
          <p>We can update your address, email or phone number. The policy, however, cannot be assigned or transferred to a new owner. The new owner would need to purchase their own policy your policy would be canceled and any return premium returned</p>
          <h5>What happens if I cancel before the end of the year?</h5>
          <p>The policy can be canceled at any time. If there are any "Additional Insureds", we have an obligation to notify them of the cancellation. After the first ninety days, the return premium is determined by your individual states' laws and regulations; however, no fees are ever returned. Should you purchase the policy and decide to cancel for any reason (even minutes later), 25% of the premium is nonrefundable.</p>
          <h5>How do I cancel a policy?</h5>
          <p>There is a tab for "Policy Changes" or "Cancelations".

This will be handled manually and it can take 4-6 weeks for the cancellation to be processed. If you have chosen a payment plan, there may be additional payments collected before processing is complete; however, we will return every penny we owe you.</p>
          <h5>What happens if I do not pay my installments?</h5>
          <p>All installments will be drawn directly from the debit or credit card uses to purchase the policy without additional action by you. If you are canceled for nonpayment of premium or insufficient funds in your account we will return any premium that has been paid but not earned (meaning used up). Fees will not be refunded and we cannot reinstate your coverage. Again, we are obligated to notify any and all "Additional Insureds" of cancellation.</p>
          <h5>Renewing your policy!</h5>
          <p>Starting at about 6 weeks prior to policy expiration, you will receive a series of emails. If you want to renew, all current information will be included for you to review, including information on your dog and your contact information will be included for you to review, including information on your dog and your contact information. Once you sign your state required documents, you go directly to the final page, select your payment option and enter your card information. If you do not want to renew, simply opt out. If your policy was canceled during the year, we will not contact you further.</p>
          <h5>Why are our premiums lower than other companies?</h5>
          <p>This policy was designed with a unique rating and underwriting process. The questions you answer give us the information we need to determine if we can offer you a quote and for what price. Automation is necessary to readily assist as many owners as possible at the lowest cost and to do so in the most efficient and timely manner.</p>
